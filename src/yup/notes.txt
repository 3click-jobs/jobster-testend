Previous version of schemas and middleware have tried to act smart - 
  sending a nice errors object as a respones, with validation errors attached to field names.

While it is a good concept and it works well with the frontend, I must try to mirror the backend 
  both in behaviour and in messaging
  behaviour -> validation rules
  messaging -> statuses and error responses
