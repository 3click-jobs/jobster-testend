# Simple Backend Simulator
  
Built with [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server), [lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb) and the great [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) validation library. Default dev environment with babel and nodemon set up thanks to [minimal-node-application](https://github.com/rwieruch/minimal-node-application)
  
## Installation  
  
* `git clone git@github.com:3click-jobs/jobster-testend`
* `cd jobster-testend`
* `npm install`
* `npm run serve`

## How-to  
  
* You can access and browse the api from the browser @http://localhost:3001  
* For POST-ing, PUT-ing and DELETE-ing, you can use POSTMAN or the early alpha stage frontend  
* You can grab a starter POSTMAN collection with some request from the root directory  
* TIP: you can reset the db state by GET-ing `/reset` and you can clear it at the `/clear` endpoint   

## Disclaimer

This is very basic version of the application, in a raw stage. It is a proof-of-concept with minimal functionality. That said, it will get better in a few days.
